#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### The app will look for different holidays that you can search for and buy. It will include hotels and flights   
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create a new file that describes the logo image to be generated.

Please add the current contents of `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for that file. Once that file is added, I’ll also give you the block to create `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`.
