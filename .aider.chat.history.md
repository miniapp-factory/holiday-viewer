#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### The app will look for different holidays that you can search for and buy. It will include hotels and flights   
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create a new file that describes the logo image to be generated.

Please add the current contents of `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for that file. Once that file is added, I’ll also give you the block to create `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`.

A serene beach scene with turquoise water, white sand, a few palm trees, and a bright blue sky. The foreground shows gentle waves lapping the shore, while a small sailboat floats in the distance.

A modern hotel building with glass facades and a rooftop garden. The structure is tall, with multiple floors, and a small parking lot in front. The background shows a clear blue sky and a few clouds. The illustration should be flat, with a palette of blues, greys, and greens, and a subtle shadow under the building to give depth.

A sleek commercial airplane in flight, seen from a slightly low angle. The plane has a white body with blue and red accents, and visible wings and tail.
