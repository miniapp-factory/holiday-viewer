An airport terminal with a large glass facade, a sign reading “Airport” in bold letters, and a few planes parked on the tarmac. The foreground shows a small parking lot with cars and a taxiway leading to the runway. The background is a clear blue sky with a few clouds. The illustration should be flat, with a palette of blues, greys, and whites, and a subtle shadow under the terminal to give depth.
